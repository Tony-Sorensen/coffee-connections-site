          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Through my own journey with PTSD and mental health struggles, I found a purpose rooted in presence, connection, and care.<br><br>
            <strong>Coffee & Connections</strong> exists to remind you: <strong>It’s okay NOT to be okay.</strong><br><br>
            Here, you’ll find a warm cup of coffee, kind people to connect with, a game to play, or simply a quiet corner to reflect with a good book.<br><br>
            We don’t let people slip through the cracks—we extend hands, offer ears, and lend voices. Because at Coffee & Connections, radical welcome isn’t just a phrase…<br><br>
            <strong>It’s a promise!</strong><br><br>

          <h2>The Founding Circle</h2>
          <p>Where lived experience, ethical leadership, and shared healing come to the table.</p>
        </header>

     <section id="founding-intro" class="founding-section">
       <p>This initiative is built by those who don’t just understand trauma, resilience, and radical <br>
          reinvention—they’ve lived it, shaped by personal histories of hardship, healing, and the unyielding <br>
          pursuit of purpose. It is not just a symbolic effort but a living testament to what happens when lived <br>
          experience meets courageous action. </p>
        
       <p>Every seat in this circle honors a voice rooted in hard-earned wisdom—individuals who have endured and <br>
          evolved, not in isolation, but through connection, care, and relentless advocacy. These founding voices <br>
          champion trust when systems fail, protect dignity where it’s been denied, and choose community-first growth<br>
          over performative visibility or empty platitudes.</p>
        
       <p>Their contributions go far beyond affiliation—they are co-builders of a movement centered on radical welcome, <br>
          transparency, and peer-powered healing. Whether they arrive as advocates, creatives, practitioners, or quiet <br>
          anchors behind the scenes, each member of this circle holds a unique key to unlocking shared resilience. <br>
          Their presence signals that Coffee & Connections is not just an idea, but a fully realized commitment to <br>
          changing how society holds space for pain, potential, and personal truth.</p>
        
      <p>Together, these seats offer not just recognition—but representation. They are reminders that transformation <br>
          is possible when trust is earned, voices are shared, and people are honored not for what they’ve lost, but <br>
          for what they’re building.</p>
